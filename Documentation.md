# Documentation

Hi! This file is for our future selves. Here I will write down the pygame functions used in our project and what they do.


 ## pygame.display.get_surface()

Using `pygame.display.get_surface()` is particularly useful in more complex projects where multiple modules or functions may need access to the main display surface without having to pass it as an argument each time.

In summary, `pygame.display.get_surface()` provides a convenient way to **obtain a reference to the main surface on which all game elements are drawn**. This allows for a more flexible and modular approach to programming in Pygame.
